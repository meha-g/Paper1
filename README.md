Followed by downloading and cleaning the data set from the Open Data Toronto Portal.

We include summary statistics and a data extract that focuses on assault rates in neighborhoods.

We create historgrams of assault rates that highlight key features and the distribution

Additionally we analyze the relationship between high population neighborhoods and assaults through scatter plots.

We conclude with references that cite all packages utilized.
